# AcademicProject_CoronaVirusPredictionAndAnalysis

Through this project “Analyzation and Prediction of Spread of Corona”, we would like to present our Machine Learning Analysis of COVID 19.

This analysis can be useful for government officials and public health officials, to analyse the current situation and can get to know more insights about the impact of corona in the future. So with this project, we would like to predict the spread of corona for the future 30 days, for the whole world as well as for the United States of America.


Many were being infected by Corona from the past 4-5 months. There were many deaths due to Corona and many of them were fighting against it and getting recovered. The main concern of this Virus, the symptoms are seen only after 14-15 days, after the person is infected with this virus. So many people are falling prey for this virus. So, initially, when we submitted the proposal for this project, the cases were registered only in China and only a few cases in the USA. But, it was a hot topic at that time. And also at that time, we don’t have much data about this Virus, but our curiosity to analyse about this virus, made us land in this project.


So, Regression Machine Learning Algorithm is used for the prediction of the number of corona infected cases, deaths and recoveries for the whole and as the USA is the most affected country, we have chosen USA, to predict only the number of corona cases for the USA for the next 30 days. We are going to analyse the situation for future.
